> [!WARNING]  
> Elastic Enterprise Search is now reaching End of Life. Elastic has announced that it will not be supported beyond
> version 8, and that maintenance support will be halted 21 months after the release of version 9 (the date of which

> Keep in mind, the core Discoverer module was designed to be service agnostic - so, once you pick a new search
> provider, you just need to create a plugin module for Discoverer (if there isn't one already). Your application's
> search implementation shouldn't actually have to change.
> 
> Elasticsearch (which is the core technology that Enterprise Search was built on) will still be supported into the
> future, so that is definitely one option that you could look in to.

## Purpose

The purpose of this module is to provide you with the ability to perform search queries to Elastic Enterprise Search
(App Search) engines through Silverstripe controllers.

**Note:** App Search is one of the products included in Elastic Enterprise Search, the two names are currently used
interchangably in this module. This module does not currently provide support for Workplace Search (which is the
**other** product that is included in Enterprise Search).

## Installation

```shell script
composer require silverstripe/silverstripe-discoverer-elastic-enterprise
```

## Specify environment variables

The following environment variables are required for this module to function:

```
ENTERPRISE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT="https://abc123.app-search.ap-southeast-2.aws.found.io"
ENTERPRISE_SEARCH_ENGINE_PREFIX="engine-name-excluding-variant"
ENTERPRISE_SEARCH_API_SEARCH_KEY="search-abc123"
```

## Usage

Please see the documentation provided in (Discoverer)[https://github.com/silverstripeltd/silverstripe-discoverer].

As mentioned above, this module serves as an "adaptor provider" for Discoverer. Besides the installation steps and
environment variables above, you shouldn't really be interacting with this module in your code.
